## Notes

#### GraphQL vs Apollo
- GraphQL is a data query language while Apollo belongs to "Platform as a Service" category of the tech stack. Apollo sits in between the client and the servers. 

#### Advantages
- No over/under fetching 
- Type system
  - Catches silly errors
  - Self documenting
  - Tooling (GraphQL code generator & Apollo)

#### Disadvantages
- Monitoring
- Caching 
- Exposed for arbitrary requests
